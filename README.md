# GoalToGoal
Project for Argus Labs interview - Game where you try to score yourself against a PvP opponent

I have created two players that are to be controlled using the spacebar and the mouse cursor. It will move in the direction of the mouse cursor.
The goal of the game was to have two players that have goals behind them, you need to get past your opponent and score yourself in the goal.

I was able to setup the base of this with some UI but have been running into issues of the server/client connection.

I have run into a lot of issue
- the 2nd player will not move, I've attempted to change this in many ways but I can't seem to get that working
- Lots of server to client rpcs just not connecting how I would like. After a score I'm trying to get both clients to update with that information and it just isn't happening.
